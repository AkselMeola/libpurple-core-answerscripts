libPurple core-answerscripts plugin
	- Framework for hooking scripts to respond received messages for various libpurple clients such as pidgin or finch
	- This simple plugin just passes every single message received by any libPurple-based client (pidgin,finch) to sript(s) in user's home directory... So you can add various hooks to your pidgin or finch without need of writing and compiling own C plugin or messing with buggy perl plugin and restarting client after each change in plugin.
	- There are already few sample (answer)scripts in purple directory, so you can check how easy it is to write some script for pidgin or finch...


Building & installation:

- The libpurple header files are needed to compile the plugin.

- To build and install :
	You can compile the plugin using
	$ make
	and install it with
	$ make install
	This will install it in ~/.purple/plugins so that only the user who install it can use it.
	$ make user
	Install main script and sample answerscripts to ~/.purple/answerscripts.d/

- To install it for everybody on your computer,
	$ make
	$ su
	# make install PREFIX="/path/to/libpurple" (this command as root user)
	generally /path/to/libpurple is /usr or /usr/local. If you don't know the path then you can find out using
	$ whereis libpurple
	and look for the part before "/lib/libpurple.so".
